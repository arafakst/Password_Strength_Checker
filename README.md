# Password-Strength-Checker
This code can help you determine how strong your password is by checking its length, complexity, and whether or not it is in a list of commonly used passwords. A strong password is one that is difficult to guess or crack, and it should be at least 8 characters long, contain a mix of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols, and not be a common word or phrase.
